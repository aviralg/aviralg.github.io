I am a Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at the [[http://prl.ccs.neu.edu/][Programming Research Laboratory]],
[[https://www.northeastern.edu][Northeastern University]], advised by [[http://janvitek.org/][Professor Jan Vitek]]. I received a Bachelors
degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [[http://www.nsit.ac.in/][Netaji Subhas Institute
of Technology]].

I am interested in addressing *programming language ecosystem evolution* through
empirical evaluations and program analysis. I am designing a tool to migrate the
[[https://www.r-project.org/][R]] language ecosystem from lazy to strict semantics with minimal impact on legacy
code. By delaying the evaluation of side-effecting and reflective arguments, R
makes it difficult for users to reason about their programs. My research aims to
introduce strictness to R functions:
1. /automatically/: to scale to large codebases, and
2. /accurately/: to prevent client code from breaking.


I live in Malden, Massachusetts. Feel free to contact me at =aviral@aviral.io=.
