I am a second year [[http://www.ccis.northeastern.edu][Computer Science]] Ph.D. student at [[http://www.northeastern.edu/][Northeastern University]], 
advised by [[http://www.janvitek.org/][Professor Jan Vitek]]. I am a member of the [[http://prl.ccs.neu.edu/][Programming Research Laboratory]]. I am interested in the design and implementation of programming languages. Specifically, my research interests are gradual typing and compiler optimizations.

Previously I worked at [[https://www.ncbs.res.in/][National Center for Biological Sciences]] under [[https://www.ncbs.res.in/faculty/bhalla][Professor Upinder S. Bhalla]], initially as a Programmer and subsequently as a Technology Manager. Before that, I worked at Yahoo! as a Software Developer.

I live in [[https://www.google.com/maps/place/Malden,+MA/@42.4253421,-71.0603243,14.25z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89e373d5cdc028c3:0x5e52fc1c1d5af24a!8m2!3d42.4250964!4d-71.066163][Malden, Massachusetts]].

I love cooking and origami.
