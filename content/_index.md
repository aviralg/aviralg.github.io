I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student advised by Professor Jan Vitek at
Programming Research Laboratory, Northeastern University. I have a Bachelors
degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Netaji Subhas Institute
of Technology.

Previously, I worked at National Center for Biological Sciences, and Yahoo!.

Broadly, I am interested in developing mechanisms for data-driven evolution of
mainstream programming language ecosystems. For this, I employ empirical
evaluations, dynamic, and static analyses.

Currently I am working on switching R from lazy-by-default to lazy-on-demand
semantics. The interaction of R's laziness with missing arguments, side-effects,
metaprogramming and reflective operations introduces challenges for users,
developers, and language implementors. I am trying to develop tools and
algorithms to switch R's semantics with minimal impact to legacy code. To
validate my approach, I am leveraging millions of lines of code available from
CRAN, R's official package repository.
