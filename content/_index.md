I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student advised by [Professor Jan
Vitek](http://janvitek.org/) at [Programming Research
Laboratory](https://prl.ccs.neu.edu/), [Northeastern
University](https://www.northeastern.edu/).

Broadly, I am interested in developing mechanisms for data-driven evolution of
mainstream programming language ecosystems. For this, I employ empirical
evaluations, dynamic, and static analyses.

Currently I am working on switching [R](https://www.r-project.org/) from a
lazy-by-default to lazy-on-demand language. The interaction of laziness with
side-effects, metaprogramming and reflective operations introduces challenges
for users, developers, and implementors of R. I am trying to develop tools and
algorithms to switch the language to strict semantics with minimal impact to its
ecosystem.
