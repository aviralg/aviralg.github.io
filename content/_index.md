I am a third year [Computer Science](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) Ph.D. student at [Northeastern University](http://www.northeastern.edu/). I am a member of the [Programming Research Laboratory](http://prl.ccs.neu.edu/). I am interested in all aspects related to the design and implementation of programming languages.
Currently, I am studying laziness (call-by-need) in [R](https://www.r-project.org/).

I am an intern at [Oracle Labs Austria](https://labs.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=94065:23:1164181105818::NO::P23%5FLOCATION%5FID:24). Previously, I was involved in a research project at [National Center for Biological Sciences](https://www.ncbs.res.in/). Before that, I worked at Yahoo! as a Software Developer.

I live in Malden, Massachusetts.
