![Me](/static/me.jpg "Me, on the banks of Charles River.")

Hi! I'm **[Aviral Goel](http://aviral.io/about)**. I'm a [Computer Science](http://www.ccis.northeastern.edu/) PhD. student at [Northeastern University](http://www.northeastern.edu/) where I am a part of the [Programming Research Laboratory](http://prl.ccs.neu.edu/), advised jointly by [Prof. Jan Vitek](http://www.janvitek.org) and [Prof. Frank Tip](http://www.franktip.org/). I am interested in the design and implementation of programming languages. Currently, I am developing a [static program analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis) technique to optimize [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html), a dynamically typed, functional, object-oriented programming language for statistical computing and graphics.

I have always found immense joy and satisfaction in building things. Programming gives me an opportunity to solve problems creatively. It poses a unique challenge in terms of design and architectural coherence, whose subtle interplay exposes complex algorithms through simple and elegant abstractions, enabling the creation of tools which have become indispensable today. I find the pursuit of this fine balance between design and engineering, very engaging and satisfying.

I also enjoy learning new programming languages, especially ones which make me think differently.

I am a huge fan of cartoons and super hero movies.
