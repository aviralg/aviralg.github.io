Hi. I'm Aviral Goel.

I live in Boston, MA. I'm studying Computer Science at [Northeastern University](http://www.northeastern.edu/), with a specialization in Programming Languages.

I have always found immense joy and satisfaction in building things. Programming gives me an opportunity to solve problems creatively. It poses a unique challenge in terms of design and architectural coherence, whose subtle interplay exposes complex algorithms through simple and elegant abstractions, enabling the creation of tools which have become indispensable today. I find the pursuit of this fine balance between design and engineering, very engaging and satisfying.

I also enjoy learning new programming languages, especially ones which make me think differently.

I am a huge fan of cartoons and super hero movies.
