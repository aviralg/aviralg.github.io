Hello, <br/>

<p class="text-justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am Aviral Goel and this is my fortress of solitude.
I am a not so young computer programmer from India.
I am currently employed by INSTEM as a Technology Manager.
Its a fancy designation, but all it really means is that I do programming.
I am working on the GUI and visualization aspects of the MOOSE project.

<p class="text-justify">Programming, for me, is a creative pursuit. I have always found immense joy and satisfaction in building things. Programming gives me an opportunity to solve problems creatively. It poses a unique challenge in terms of design and architectural coherence, whose subtle interplay exposes complex algorithms through simple and elegant abstractions, enabling the creation of tools which have become indispensable today. I find the pursuit of this fine balance between design and engineering, very engaging and satisfying.</p>


<!-- <p class="text-justify">I love origami, the ancient Japanese art of paper folding. I have made plenty of Kusudama and Modular Origami Polyhedra. I have also tried my hand at some of Lang's Polypolyhedron. I enjoy origami a lot. You can have a look at some of the models I folded by clicking on the origami link above.</p>

<p class="text-justify">I have been trying to learn Violin for about a year now. Its quite complicated, as is normally the case with bowed string instruments.</p>
